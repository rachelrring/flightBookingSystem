# flightBookingSystem

Completed this project as a part of my college course in first year
In this project:
  - create FlightBooking class
  - FlightBooking has: initialiser, get_cost(), print(), apply_charge(), generate_pwd(), get_number_of_business_class()

This project currently does not take user input and works off of values I have hardcoded in myself
